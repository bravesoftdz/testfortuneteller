# testfortuneteller
The first testing of the program "fortune-teller" with changing the code of the program.


Added a random number of petals, changed the "Map" of answers from the fortuneteller, and the output of the menu. The menu is created based on groups in the "Map". Some methods, constants are transferred to separate classes. There is also a separate class for initializing the "Map" with answers from fortuneteller.
